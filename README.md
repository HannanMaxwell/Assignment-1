## First git status output:

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

## Second git status output:

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

## Purpose of the following Commands:

- `mkdir`: This command makes a new directory.
- `cd`: This command changes the directory to the desired one.
- `code`: This command opens the default text editor installed.
- `ls`: This command lists all the files and directories in the current directory.

## Why Version Control is Important

With version control, it is possible to:

-back up files and reverting back to older versions of the files if needed.
-merge different changes which were made by different people.
-branch the main project to multiple branches which allows for different 
 people to work on them and then later they can merge the branches back into the main project.
-track changes made to the files, allowing for reverting back to the old version of a file if needed.

## Purpose of the following Git Commands

- `git init`: Initializes or creates a new repository.

- `git status`: Displays the status of the directory/repository. 
                Any changes made to the files would be displayed.

- `git add`: This command adds a file/files to the staging area 
             where they are ready for commiting.

- `git commit`: This command will record all of the changes made 
                during the staging area and will allow us to write a message describing 
                on what changes were made to the files.

- `git push`: Git push, pushes the any changes made
              to the files or directories from the 
              local repository to the remote repository.

- `git pull`: Git pulls any changes made to the
              directories or files from the remote
              repository to the local repository.

- `git log`: This command displays all the commits
             that were made.

- `git branch`: This command creates a new branch.

- `git merge`: Git merge, merges all the branches into one branch.

- `git checkout`: Git checkout is used to change to a different branch.

## My Unique Touch

There are things that set me apart from others:

-I'm confident.
-I understand people on a deeper level.
-People often say I make friends easily (social.)
-I'm an honest person.
