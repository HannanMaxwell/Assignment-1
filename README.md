## First git status output:

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

## Second git status output:

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

## Purpose of the following Commands:

- `mkdir`: This command makes a new directory.
- `cd`: This command changes the directory to the desired one.
- `code`: This command opens the default text editor installed.
- `ls`: This command lists all the files and directories in the current directory.

## Why Version Control is Important

With version control, it is possible to:

-back up files and reverting back to older versions of the files if needed.
-merge different changes which were made by different people.
-branch the main project to multiple branches which allows for different people to work on them and then later they can merge the branches back into the main project.
-track changes made to the files, allowing for reverting back to the old version of a file if needed.
